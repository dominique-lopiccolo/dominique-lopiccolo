### *Research Interests*
<p>ðŸŒŽ &nbsp;&nbsp;Broadly, I'm interested in discovering the behavioral and neural mechanisms which underlie human reasoning.</p>
<p>ðŸ§  &nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, I'm interested in using the tools of functional MRI and psychophysics to shed light on this process.</p>
<p>ðŸ”¢ &nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, I'm investigating mathematical reasoning in children and adults as a specific lens into this subject.</p>
<p>ðŸ”® &nbsp;&nbsp;In the future, I aim to expand this research to other types of reasoning including logic and statistics.</p>
