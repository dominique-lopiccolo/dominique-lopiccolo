### *Research Interests*
<p>🌎 &nbsp;&nbsp;Broadly, I'm interested in discovering the behavioral and neural mechanisms which underlie <b>human reasoning</b>.</p>
<p>🧠 &nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, I'm interested in using the tools of <b>functional MRI</b> and <b>psychophysics</b> to shed light on this process.</p>
<p>🔢 &nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, I'm investigating <b>mathematical reasoning</b> in children and adults as a specific lens into this subject.</p>
<p>🔮 &nbsp;&nbsp;In the future, I aim to expand this research to other types of reasoning including <b>logic</b> and <b>statistics</b>.</p>
